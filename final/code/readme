# MPI Simulation

See individual readmes of simpi and simulator for instructions on compiling
them.

General flow for obtaining trace and simulating a MPI Application:

* run target program under tracer (LD_PRELOAD) with no hostfile but target
  number of processes set.
* concatenate all log files into one:
  ```
  $ cat *.log > agg.log
  ```
* run the simulator on this log:
  ```
  $ ./run-simulator.sh 64 ./hostfile ./agg.log
  ```
  Here 64 is the number of processes and hostfile is the target host
  distribution we want.
* The output is the time in seconds
