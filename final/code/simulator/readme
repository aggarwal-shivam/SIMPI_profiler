# simulator

The simulator can be compiled with `make`. After that the simulator can be run
with:

```
$ ./simulator  --file=./hostfile --number=16 --logs=./logs-16
```

This just runs the simulator with no outputs. A complete log of all events
taking place at a process can be obtained with:

```
$ export NS_LOG="MPINodeApplication"
$ ./simulator  --file=./hostfile --number=16 --logs=./logs-16
```

The actual runtime can be thought of as the time when the last process stops.
A helper script `run-simulator.sh` does exactly that:

```
$ ./run-simulator.sh 16 ./hostfile ./logs-16
```
